# Snake Game Java Project 🐍🎮

Welcome to my Snake Game Java project! This classic arcade game showcases my Java programming skills and game development capabilities. The objective of the game is simple: control the snake to eat the food and grow longer, but be careful not to collide with the walls or your own tail.

## Features

- Intuitive controls using arrow keys.
- Snake grows longer after eating food.
- Game over when the snake collides with walls or itself.
- Score tracking for each successful food consumption.
- Colorful graphics and smooth animation.
